Task Automation
The files are allready i run it, so in the collected_emails.txt it has seven mail ID's. To see it is extracting clear all seven mail ID's in collected_emails.txt and run it.
 Concepts Used: re, file handling (These two only need for Extract all email addresses from a .txt file and save them to another file.)
Thank you.
